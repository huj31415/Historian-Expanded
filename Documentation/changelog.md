# Changelog

### 1.3.3 for KSP 1.12.5
* Add a crew list truncation option for large crew counts
* Change week length to 7 days
* Update default layout to a custom version of u/mikusingularity's layout
* Update configurations

### 1.3.2 for KSP 1.3.1
* Fix version file URL link and make copy of file in old location to prompt legacy users to update
* Minor documentation updates

#### 1.3.1 fpr KSP 1.3.1
* Recompiled for KSP 1.3.1
* Add text tags:
    * `<Mass>` - total mass of active vessel in kg
	* `<Cost>` - total cost of active vessel
	* `<PartCount>` - number of parts in active vessel

#### 1.3 for KSP 1.3 (Dev build)
* Recompiled for KSP 1.3 - __NOT compatible with KSP 1.2.2__

__BREAKING CHANGE__
* Move Historian install folder from `GameData/KSEA/Historian` to `GameData/Historian`. If upgrading from Historian version 1.2.8 or earlier then any custom layouts must be copied to the new location and the old folder deleted.

* Localisation support 
	* where stock game provides localised values these will be displayed by `TEXT` tags. e.g. planet names, biomes, vessel types etc.
	* the file `GameData/Historian/Localisation.cfg` contains all the non-stock text strings used by Historian. This can be used to localise these values also (I don't know any of the other languages well enough to attempt this myself)
	* Date and Time formatting is delegated to the ingame default dateTimeFormatter allowing standard localised Kerbin and Earth calendar dates (as well as UT and MET) to be displayed
* Parsing of `TEXT` (and associated) blocks occurs only once when the layout is loaded rather than on every draw event as in previous versions. A parsed expression tree is cached and executed on each draw instead. This should improve both memory usage and performance in all but trivial layouts.
* Improvements to tag parser and evaluator to allow tags to accept parameters
	* `<Date(format)>` override the default dateTimeFormatter using a standard .NET date/time formatting string e.g. *<Date(dd/MM/yyyy)>*. See [documentation](Tags-Date.md) for more details.
	* `<Crew(isList, isShort, showSuffix, traits)>` replaces the existing `<Crew>`, `<CrewShort>`, `<CrewList>`, `<Pilots>`, `<PilotsShort>` etc. with a single configurable tag (previous tags are retained for backwards compatibility but are now deprecated and support may be dropped in a future version).
		* `isList` - if true displays crew names in a verticle bulleted list. If false names are displayed inline separated by commas
		* `isShort` - if true the surname (Kerman or localised equivalent) is displayed only once at end of list.  __This setting is ignored if `isList=true`.__
		* `showSuffix` - if true then a trait abbreviation will be shown after each name e.g. *Jebediah Kerman (P), Bill Kerman (E)*. The abbreviations can be defined in the new [`TRAIT`](Traits.md) block or [`TRAITDEFINITIONS`](Traits.md) file.
		* `traits` - a comma separated list of which types of crew should be listed or ALL to list everyone
		* Example: `<Crew(false, true, true, Pilots, Scouts)>` will be a comma separated list of the first names of all piots or scouts on the current vessel. See [the documentation](Tags-Crew.md) for full details and more examples.
* The `TEXT` element property `DateFormat` is now deprecated in favour of the parameterised `<Date>` tag described above
* The `TEXT` element properties `PilotColor`, `ScientistColor`, `EngineerColor` and `TouristColor` are now deprecated in favour of using [`TRAIT`](Traits.md) or [`TRAITDEFINITIONS`](Traits.md). See [documentation](Traits.md) for details.
* Fix: -ve values were always displayed in base units instead of most appropriate unit (i.e. -99999m instead of -99.999km)
* Revised and reformatted [documentation](../README.md)
* Additional [example layouts](Example.md)

#### Dev Build 1.2.9
* Updated `SITUATION_TEXT`, `ACTION_TEXT` and `TEXT_LIST` to use new tokenized string loader and evaluator
* Update source files with consistent licecnse header
* Moved readme and changelog into Historian folder rather than root of archive

__BREAKING CHANGE__
* Move Historian install folder from `GameData/KSEA/Historian` to `GameData/Historian` - any custom layouts must be copied to the new location and the old folder deleted.


#### Dev build 1.2.8
* Refactor text parsing to move tokenizer into layout load rather than OnDraw should improve performance of layouts with large number of tags substantially with no penalty to simple layouts
* Add unit tests for text parser tokenizing and reconstituting
* Add initial support for parameterized tags (e.g. `Crew(Medics)`) - actual tags still to be implemented
* Add `TRAIT { Name Suffix Color }` block level node on TEXT element definition for specifying trait names, colours and abbreviations (to support for custom traits e.g. from USI MKS) - legacy PilotColor etc. still supported

__KNOWN ISSUES__
* Tokenized parsing not yet implemented for layout blocks inheriting from TEXT so they currently show blank

#### 1.2.7 for KSP 1.2.2
* Fix issue #10 where configuration dialog would not show correctly if settings.cfg file had to be created during start-up (e.g. after first installing mod and add action to Visual Studio build sequence to automatically delete settings.cfg so I don't overlook this breaking in the future
*  Add configuration option to allow setting text to be shown for empty crew slots i.e. in `pilot`, `scientist`, `engineer` (and short or list variants) tags when no crew of that type are present in vessel. *Default = None (same as previous version)*
* Add configuration option to allow setting text to be shown in `Crew`, `CrewShort` or `CrewList` tags for a vessel with no crew. *Default = unmanned (same as previous version)*.
* Fix #13 Out by one error when displaying Kerbin formatted dates.
* Modify text parsing routines to remove many temporary strings and to use cached stringbuilder if available. Should reduce garbage collection footprint.


#### 1.2.6
* Recompile for 1.2.1
* Update toolbar wrapper to latest version for compatibility with Contract Configurator
* Not tested against Kerbal Konstructs or KSCSwitcher as no 1.2 compatible versions exist at this time

	* optional `EXCLUDE` block with list of named `Element` blocks from inherited layout to exclude from combined layout ([Example](https://github.com/Aelfhe1m/Historian-Expanded/blob/master/GameData/KSEA/Historian/Layouts/inherit_C.layout)).


#### 1.2.4.12 for KSP 1.1.2

#### 1.2.2.11 for KSP 1.1.2
* Change persistence model for configuration settings to use game save files rather than a config file in GameData. NOTE: Starting a new save will set configuration to default values. Reverting a flight or quickloading may load an older version of the configuration if you've made recent changes.

#### 1.2.1.14 for KSP 1.1.2
* Regression fix for `DateFormat` - same issue as with crew trait colouring

#### 1.2.1.9 for KSP 1.1.2

	* `RealDate` - the real world date and time formatted using the block level DateFormat setting
* Support for Kerbal Konstructs](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/94863-112-kerbal-konstructs-v0967_ex-holy-glowing-balls-batman/) and [Kerbin Side](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/74776-112-kerbin-side-v110-supplements/)
	* `LaunchSite` modified to detect most recently set KK launch site
	* `KK-SpaceCenter` - the closest detected "space center"

* Setting added to main configuration dialog for "Default space center name". Will replace "KSC" in `LaunchSite` or `KK-SpaceCenter` parameter results. NOTE: only replaces the value if "KSC" is the full return value. "KSC Launch pad", "Kerbal Space Center" or similar results will NOT be affected
* `TEXT` and `SITUATION_TEXT` blocks can now specify a `Font` property for the name of the OS font to use to display the block. NOTE: font name must EXACTLY match OS font name. A utility parameter `ListFonts` is supplied to list the names of all installed fonts.
* "Historian.cfg" moved to `GameData\KSEA\Historian\Plugins` folder to avoid interfering with Module Manager caching.
* Current version number displayed in settings window title bar
* General code clean-up and refactoring

* Add text node parameters for date support:
  * DateKAC - formatted date calculated based on number of seconds (UT) since base start date. This date includes leap years.
  * YearKAC - the current year of the variable length date. At start and end of year may not match the Yx Dx display shown in game.
  * DayKAC - the current day of the variable length date. At start and end of year may not match the Yx Dx display shown in game. Some years will have 366 days.
  * MET - an alias for T+. The mission ellapsed time.
